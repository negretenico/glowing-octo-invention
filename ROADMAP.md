Love that. Here’s a tight, do-it-yourself roadmap—no big dumps, just bite-sized milestones with clear “done” checks. Pick one and build; I’ll be your rubber duck and reviewer.

# Ground rules (keep scope tight)

* Java 17+, Gradle/Maven, **web3j**.
* Local chain: **Foundry Anvil** (fast, forkable).
* One CLI: `java -jar fuzz.jar --rpc http://127.0.0.1:8545 --seed 1337 --target out/Contract.json:Contract`.
* Hard cap: ≤600 LOC per milestone.

# Milestone 1 — Hello Fuzz Loop (single function)

**Goal:** Send randomized calldata to one function and log outcomes.

**You build:**

* Load ABI (from Foundry artifact JSON).
* Pick one public function with only value types (e.g., `deposit(uint256)`).
* Deterministic RNG from `--seed`.
* Mutator v0: uniform random for each ABI type.
* Oracle v0: record `success | revert | out_of_gas` + gas used.

**Done when:**

* 1k tx run in <15s on Anvil.
* Reproducible runs with same seed.
* CSV written: `seed,fn,inputs,outcome,gas`.

# Milestone 2 — Useful Oracles

**Goal:** Catch real issues, not just reverts.

**You build:**

* Invariant oracle: sum(balances) == contractBalance after each tx.
* Gas oracle: flag > N gas (choose N).
* Event oracle: watch for `Panic(uint256)` or custom `InvariantBroke()` events.
* Crash triage: save **minimized** input by length (simple best-so-far, no shrinking yet).

**Done when:**

* Invariants trigger on a deliberately buggy contract.
* Report file captures first failing input + tx hash.

# Milestone 3 — Stateful Sequences

**Goal:** Reproduce sequence-dependent bugs.

**You build:**

* Corpus: list of **actions** (function + args).
* Generator: create sequences of length 2–4 using your RNG.
* State reset between sequences by redeploying or snapshot/revert (Anvil `evm_snapshot`/`evm_revert`).
* Oracle: final-state invariant after the whole sequence.

**Done when:**

* You can encode `deposit → withdraw → withdraw` and detect overdraft in a naive bank.

# Milestone 4 — Reentrancy Harness

**Goal:** Detect reentrancy with an attacker contract.

**You build:**

* Attacker.sol with fallback calling back into target.
* Sequence: deploy target → fund → deploy attacker → trigger attack.
* Oracle: target balance unexpectedly decreases below expected floor OR attacker drains > threshold.

**Done when:**

* Works on a purposely vulnerable `withdraw()` and stays silent on a fixed version.

# Milestone 5 — Static Analyzer (minimal, Java-first)

**Goal:** Fast heuristics without building a full compiler.

**You build:**

* Consume `solc --combined-json abi,bin,ast`.
* Checks (regex + AST walk):

    * `tx.origin` in conditionals.
    * `delegatecall` usage.
    * Low-level `.call{value:…}` without reentrancy guard.
    * Public/external functions modifying critical state without `onlyOwner`-like guard.
* Output SARIF or simple JSON.

**Done when:**

* Flags real issues in a small vulnerable suite and stays quiet on safe variants.

# Stretch (later)

* Input shrinking (delta-debugging).
* Coverage-lite via Anvil `debug_traceCall` or opcode counts.
* Corpus mutation (AFL-ish): keep interesting seeds that change an oracle/coverage bit.
* Forked mainnet targets with method selectors discovered from 4byte/ABI (advanced).

# Quality bar (self-check)

* Reproducible with `--seed`.
* ≤2s start-to-first-tx.
* Clear, short README: how to run, how to add a new target, how to add an oracle.
* Tests: one unit test per oracle; one integration test per milestone.

If you tell me which milestone you’re starting with, I’ll give you a tiny checklist and just the minimal snippets/interfaces to accelerate **that one step**—nothing more.
